# Restaurant

A simple react application for ordering food

### How it works
There is a list of products, user can filter specified food category. On the right side there is a receipt
updated every time when user add something to order. After clicking the button on the receipt, the left side changes, we see delivery informations.
After submitting the order, it is saved into database and the last "thank you" page is displayed.


### Below a bit of preview how it works.
